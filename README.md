# Programming Problems

I decided to organize the challenges and contests of educational sites like Codewars,
Exercism, Codeforces, etc in this directory. 

For every file `site/challenge/challenge.<language extension>`,
I try to complete the site's challenge using idiomatic and elegant programs written in that language.

Also, the code style differs from those in competitive programming, where very
short variable names and other time-saving, but unreadable, practices are common.

The current sites are:
