# UVa Notes

[UVa's website](uva.onlinejudge.com) seems to be abandoned. In particular, it
doesn't seem to send verification emails for new registrations, which disables
solution submission. 

However, it has a very rich set of problems, and there's a workaround for
the aforementioned issue. It consists of using [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/) 
to submit to UVa problems.
